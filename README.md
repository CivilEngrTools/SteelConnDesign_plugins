<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Plugin System of CET.SteelConnDesign</h1>

CET.SteelConnDesign is a FREE, cutting-edge steel connection design software built on the AISC 13th/14th/15th standards and powered by modern mathematical theories, providing users with a powerful design solution.  

CET.SteelConnDesign embraces open-source principles for engineering and is exploring the possibility of transitioning to an open-source model in the future. The introduction of plugins is our first step in this direction. This system is designed to offer valuable tools that assist users in their designs while also enabling them to share their innovative ideas with the community.  

Some plugins, such as the Member Property Plugin, require the “CET_MODULE.cp38-win_amd64.pyd” file, located in the CET.SteelConnDesign installation directory (`C:\Users\<User Name>\AppData\Roaming\CET_SteelConnDesign\`, replacing `<User Name>` with your actual username). However, this file is not necessary for developing your own plugins.
